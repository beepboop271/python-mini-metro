# python-mini-metro
grade 10 comp sci with python (ICS2OG) final project. had to build some game that uses what we learned in the semester and i decided to recreate the game "mini metro". run the "Mini Metro.py" file to play. the gameplay is fairly similar to the actual mini metro, but the controls may be slightly different.
